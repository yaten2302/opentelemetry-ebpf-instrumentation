# Supported Protocols

This section describes language-agnostic protocol instrumentation. Some context propagation support is only available
through language-specific library instrumentation documented later in this file.

## Go Instrumentation

Specifically for Go applications, OBI chooses to instrument libraries directly using Uprobes, instead of instrumenting
at the network level. This allows for more accurate tracing and context propagation.
This set of instrumentations currently replaces all the network level instrumentation for Go applications.
To turn this off and fallback to the normal network based instrumentation for Go processes, you set
`discovery.skip_go_specific_tracers` to `true` in the config, or set the environment variable
`OTEL_EBPF_SKIP_GO_SPECIFIC_TRACERS=true`.

## Payload Capture

OBI can capture full request and response payloads for some protocols and forward them to userspace for richer analysis
(e.g. SQL body extraction, Kafka Metadata parsing). This feature is disabled by default.

Each limit is applied **per request and per direction independently**: the configured value caps the total bytes captured
for the request direction and, separately, the total bytes captured for the response direction. For example,
`OTEL_EBPF_BPF_BUFFER_SIZE_HTTP=4096` captures up to 4096 bytes of request body and up to 4096 bytes of response body.
Large payloads are streamed to userspace across multiple ring-buffer events and reassembled there.

| Environment variable               | Protocol   | Maximum | Default      |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------:|--------:|:------------:|
| `OTEL_EBPF_BPF_BUFFER_SIZE_HTTP`   | HTTP       | 65535   | 0 (disabled) |
| `OTEL_EBPF_BPF_BUFFER_SIZE_MYSQL`  | MySQL      | 65535   | 0 (disabled) |
| `OTEL_EBPF_BPF_BUFFER_SIZE_KAFKA`  | Kafka      | 65535   | 0 (disabled) |
| `OTEL_EBPF_BPF_BUFFER_SIZE_POSTGRES` | PostgreSQL | 65535 | 0 (disabled) |

Equivalent YAML keys live under `ebpf.buffer_sizes.{http,mysql,kafka,postgres}`.

## GPU Instrumentation

Specifically for instrumenting GPU execution primitives, like NVIDIA CUDA kernel launches and memory copies. This
instrumentation support differs from traditional GPU metrics, such as GPU utilization and GPU temperature.

| Library                        |  Primitives                                                                      |             Versions | Limitations
|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|---------------------:|------------:
| libcuda                        |    cudaLaunchKernel, cudaGraphLaunch, cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, cudaMemcpyAsync    |               >= 7.0 |         N/A

# Supported Context propagation frameworks

For Inter-process context propagation, OBI by default assumes actions happening the same thread are part of the same
trace.
but in many cases, especially in asynchronous programming models, the context might be propagated across threads or even
processes.
OBI has support for several asynchronous frameworks that allow it to propagate context in these scenarios.

| Framework           | Languages |         Versions | Limitations                                       | Status
